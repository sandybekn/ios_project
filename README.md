# Idea of the project: 
  I would like to create drawing album app
# Small description: 
  This app will allow to create new drawings and keep them in a list. Also, the user can delete or edit them. In the process of drawing users can choose any color and size of brush 
# My wish list:
•	Add drawings into album
•	Add sticker for notes
•	Share with drawings through social media
•	Add effects for drawings( blur, contrast, shade)
